# Applied Statistics Module

This repository contains two Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate key concepts and methods in Applied Statistics. The notebooks explore various statistical techniques and provide practical examples for understanding statistical analysis.

## Notebooks Overview

### [Notebook 1: Tasks](tasks.ipynb)
In this notebook, 4 tasks are implemented to work through several key concepts in statistics. These include:
1. Task 1 - Permutations and Combinations
2. Task 2 - `numpy`'s Normal Distribution
3. Task 3 - t-Test Calculation
4. Task 4 - ANOVA

### [Notebook 2: Project](project.ipynb)
This notebook focuses on working through a project analysing the [PlantGrowth R dataset](https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/csv/datasets/PlantGrowth.csv). The dataset includes weights for plants under control and two treatment types. In the project t-tests and ANOVA are used to analyse whether there is any significant difference between the groups.

## Requirements

To run these notebooks, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
